<p>
    <br>->Bruce Lee, Chinese name Li Jun Fan, (born November 27, 1940, San Francisco, California, U.S.—died July 20, 1973, Hong Kong)</br> 
    <br>->American-born film actor who was renowned for his martial arts prowess and who helped popularize martial arts movies in the 1970s.</br>
    <br>->Lee was born in San Francisco, but he grew up in Hong Kong. He was introduced to the entertainment industry at an early age, as his father was an opera singer and part-time actor.</br> 
    <br>->The younger Lee began appearing in films as a child and was frequently cast as a juvenile delinquent or street urchin.</br> 
    <br>->As a teenager, he took up with local gangs and began learning kung fu to better defend himself. </br>
    <br>->At that time he also started dance lessons, which further refined his footwork and balance.</br>
    <br>->In 1958 Lee won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship.</br>

    <br>->Lee’s parents were increasingly disturbed by his street fighting and run-ins with the police, and they sent him to live in the United States shortly after he turned 18.</br>
    <br>->He lived with family friends in Seattle, where he finished high school and studied philosophy and drama at the University of Washington. While in Seattle he opened his first martial arts school.</br> 
    <br>->In 1964 he relocated to Oakland, California, to found a second school.</br>
    <br>->It was about that time that he developed his own technique—jeet kune do, a blend of ancient kung fu, fencing, boxing, and philosophy—which he began teaching instead of traditional martial arts. He drew the attention of a television producer after giving a kung fu demonstration at a Los Angeles-area karate tournament, and he was cast as the sidekick Kato in the television series The Green Hornet (1966–67).</br>
